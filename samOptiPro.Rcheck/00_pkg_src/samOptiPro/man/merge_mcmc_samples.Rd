\title{Merge two MCMC sample objects into a single mcmc.list}
\usage{
merge_mcmc_samples(res)
}
\value{
An object of class \code{mcmc.list} containing all chains from both
inputs.
}
\description{
Combine \code{res$samples} and \code{res$samples2} (or any two objects
coercible to \code{mcmc} objects) into a single \code{mcmc.list}. Each
input is converted using \code{coda::as.mcmc} before being combined.
}
\details{
This helper is intended for internal use in cases where a model produces
two separate sample objects (for example, when running a baseline sampler
and an additional HMC sampler). Both inputs are converted to MCMC objects
and returned as a single list of chains.
