\title{Assess MCMC performance metrics (ESS, R-hat, AE, CE)}
\usage{
assess_performance(samples, runtime_s, rhat_thresh = 1.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{A list of MCMC samples or any object that can be converted
by \code{as_mcmc_list()}.}

\item{runtime_s}{Numeric scalar. Total runtime of the MCMC run (seconds).}

\item{rhat_thresh}{Numeric scalar. Threshold used to flag R-hat values
indicating lack of convergence. Default is 1.01.}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{summary}}{A one-row tibble summarizing global diagnostics.}
\item{\code{per_param}}{A tibble containing ESS, Rhat, AE, and CE
for each parameter.}
}
}
\description{
Compute per-parameter and global diagnostics from an MCMC sample set.
Metrics include Effective Sample Size (ESS), Gelman-Rubin R-hat,
Algorithmic Efficiency (AE = ESS / total draws), and Computational
Efficiency (CE = ESS / runtime in seconds).
}
\details{
The function first coerces the input to an \code{mcmc.list} object and then
computes the following:
\itemize{
\item \strong{ESS}: Effective Sample Size for each parameter.
\item \strong{Rhat}: Gelman-Rubin diagnostic (computed only when two
or more chains are available).
\item \strong{AE}: Algorithmic efficiency, defined as ESS divided by
the total number of retained post-burnin draws.
\item \strong{CE}: Computational efficiency, defined as ESS divided by
the total runtime in seconds.
}

When the \pkg{posterior} package is installed, its implementation of
\code{rhat()} is used; otherwise, diagnostics from \pkg{coda} are applied.
