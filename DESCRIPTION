Package: samOptiPro
Title: Optimization and Diagnostics Tools for Bayesian Stock Assessment Models in NIMBLE
Version: 0.1.0
Maintainer: Romuald Hounyeme <romuald.hounyeme@agrocampus-ouest.fr>
Description: The 'samOptiPro' package provides a unified workflow for the analysis, optimization, and benchmarking of Bayesian Stock Assessment Models (SAMs) implemented in the 'nimble' framework. It includes tools to:   - diagnose model structure and differentiability,   - automatically configure and test samplers (RW, Slice, Block, HMC, NUTS),   - evaluate algorithmic (ESS/s) and computational efficiency (runtime),   - identify bottlenecks and non-differentiable nodes,   - visualize convergence diagnostics and efficiency trade-offs,   - run comparative experiments for adaptive or hybrid sampling strategies. Designed for complex ecological hierarchical models (e.g., salmon, eel recruitment), 'samOptiPro' extends the methodological base of 'samOpti' with advanced diagnostics, family-wise sampler grouping, and integration with 'nimbleHMC' for gradient-based inference.
