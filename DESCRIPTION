Description: 
    The 'samOptiPro' package provides a unified workflow for the analysis, 
    optimization, and benchmarking of Bayesian Stock Assessment Models (SAMs) 
    implemented in the 'nimble' framework. It includes tools to:
      - diagnose model structure and differentiability,
      - automatically configure and test samplers (RW, Slice, Block, HMC, NUTS),
      - evaluate algorithmic (ESS/s) and computational efficiency (runtime),
      - identify bottlenecks and non-differentiable nodes,
      - visualize convergence diagnostics and efficiency trade-offs,
      - run comparative experiments for adaptive or hybrid sampling strategies.
    Designed for complex ecological hierarchical models (e.g., salmon, eel recruitment),
    'samOptiPro' extends the methodological base of 'samOpti' with advanced diagnostics,
    family-wise sampler grouping, and integration with 'nimbleHMC' for gradient-based inference.
