\usage{
plot_family_ess_bar(
  samples,
  runtime_s,
  sampler_params = NULL,
  model = NULL,
  mcmc_conf = NULL,
  samplers_df = NULL,
  ignore_patterns = c("^lifted_", "^logProb_"),
  strict_sampler_only = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{An object that can be converted to an \code{mcmc.list}
(e.g., \code{mcmc.list}, \code{mcmc}, \code{data.frame}, or
\code{matrix}).}

\item{runtime_s}{Numeric scalar giving the total runtime in seconds.
This value is not used directly inside the plot, but is kept for
API consistency.}

\item{sampler_params}{Optional character vector; if supplied, only
parameters listed here are used when computing family-level ESS.}

\item{model}{A \code{nimbleModel}.}

\item{mcmc_conf}{Optional MCMC configuration; if \code{NULL}, one is built.}

\item{samplers_df}{Optional data.frame describing samplers (type/target).}

\item{ignore_patterns}{Optional character vector of patterns to exclude
some families.}

\item{strict_sampler_only}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, only nodes actually
sampled are considered.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing median ESS per family.
}
\description{
Produce a bar plot showing the median Effective Sample Size (ESS)
for each parameter family. A horizontal dashed line indicates the
5 percent quantile of ESS across all families.
}
\details{
Families are defined by the substring before the first "[" in
each parameter name. If \code{sampler_params} is provided, only
parameters included in that vector are used when forming families.
