\arguments{
\item{build_fn}{Function building per-chain model objects (see Builder contract).}

\item{niter}{Integer; total number of MCMC iterations.}

\item{nburnin}{Integer; number of burn-in iterations.}

\item{thin}{Integer; thinning interval.}

\item{monitors}{Optional character vector of monitored nodes.}

\item{nchains}{Integer; number of chains to run.}

\item{seed}{Integer; base seed (chain \code{k} uses \code{seed + k - 1}).}

\item{n_cores}{Integer; number of parallel workers (default = \code{nchains}).}

\item{extra_export}{Optional character vector of additional objects to export
to workers.}

\item{parallel_backend}{Character; parallel backend to use (\code{"PSOCK"},
\code{"FORK"}, or \code{"AUTO"}).}

\item{worker_log}{Logical; whether to emit minimal per-worker diagnostic logs.}

\item{useConjugacy}{Logical; passed for API consistency but ignored (slice-only).}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
\item \code{samples}    : posterior samples (combined across chains when possible)
\item \code{runtime_s}  : wall-clock runtime (seconds) for the parallel \code{runMCMC()} phase
\item \code{conf}       : \code{NULL} in parallel mode; per-chain configurations are attached
as attribute \code{conf_by_chain}
}
}
\description{
Runs multiple independent MCMC chains using a \strong{strict slice-only sampling
strategy} (\code{onlySlice} semantics), in parallel, on either a PSOCK or FORK
backend. All stochastic nodes are updated exclusively with slice samplers,
with no use of random-walk, block, conjugate, or gradient-based samplers.
}
\details{
This function is primarily intended as a \strong{robust convergence-oriented
baseline} for complex or non-differentiable models (e.g. models involving
truncated distributions, constrained parameters, or piecewise likelihoods),
for which default sampler configurations or HMC/NUTS are inappropriate.

Implementation notes:
\itemize{
\item Each worker builds and configures its own model and MCMC independently.
\item All existing samplers are removed and replaced by slice samplers on all
stochastic nodes.
\item Parallel execution can rely on a PSOCK cluster (portable) or a FORK backend
(Unix-alike systems only).
\item The reported runtime measures the wall-clock time spent in \code{runMCMC()},
excluding model construction and compilation.
}

Builder contract:
\itemize{
\item \code{build_fn()} must work either as \code{build_fn()} or
\verb{build_fn(chain_id = <int>, export_global = <logical>)}.
\item It must return a list containing at least:
\itemize{
\item \code{model}  : an uncompiled \code{nimbleModel}
\item \code{cmodel} : the compiled model (\code{compileNimble(model)})
\item \code{conf}   : an MCMC configuration object
}
}
}
